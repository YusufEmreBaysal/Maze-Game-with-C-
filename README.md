# Maze-Game-with-C++-
A maze game with simple graphics that was developed with C++ during the first quarter of 2020. All algorithms were developed entirely by me, without copying or seeking help from external sources or individuals. In the game, you input the map size, search for the key to unlock the gate, and then proceed through the gate to complete the game.
